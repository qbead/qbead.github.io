<p>For the last few years, our team has run educational events that have
enabled thousands of attendees to experience the wonder of creating
their own gadgets through science and engineering. We are proud to have
channeled our passion for creating, teaching, and civil service to
empower the next generation of makers. Through the Qbead, we hope to
reach even more students.</p>

Carlos
</h1>
<h2>
Delft University of Technology, QuTech
</h2>
<p>Carlos loves science, crafts, and art, and sometimes combines them
into a beautiful gadget like the Qbead. On top of that, he enjoys
mentoring and contributing to diversity in science and engineering.
Examples are organizing science-art workshops with asylum seekers in
Sweden and the quantum hackathon iQuHACK at MIT. Now at Delft University
of Technology and QuTech, Carlos is a professor exploring quantum
photonics while he continues to lead outreach projects to democratize
science and technology.</p>

<h1>
Stefan
</h1>
<h2>
University of Massachusetts Amherst
</h2>
<p>Since high school Stefan has enjoyed sharing the wonders of science
with others, organizing extraculicular courses and summer break Physics
events. While a graduate student at Yale’s Quantum Institute he felt
most at home in Yale’s makerspace, preparing contraptions to be used in
middle- and high-school outreach events. He continued his reasearch work
on photonic quantum computers jointly at MIT and Harvard, but spends
much of his free time designing hands-on outreach materials, including
the <a href="https://spinwearables.com/">SpinWheel</a>. Now, as a
professor at UMass Amherst, he is designing the Qbead as a way to bring
the maker ethos to teaching Quantum Information Science.</p>

Hugo
</h1>
<h2>
MIT
</h2>
<p>Hugo appreciates taking part in various efforts promoting higher
education in STEM to various communities. Since his undergraduate
studies at the University of Ottawa, these have included participation
in the university’s mini-courses program and engaging with elementary
school students about being a grad student. He is currently a doctoral
student in electrical engineering at MIT.</p>

Saumil
</h1>
<h2>
MIT
</h2>
<p>Saumil has always held a fascination for building things. As a
graduate student at MIT, Saumil worked on silicon photonics, where he
spent a great deal of time hacking together electronics and
microcontrollers to run his experiments. He also enjoys teaching and has
helped develop several courses and hands-on labs to introduce students
to photonic hardware. Saumil is now a postdoc jointly at MIT and NTT
Research, where he has continued his research at the intersection of
optics and computing. He hopes to share his love of building hardware
through the Qbead and inspire the next generation of quantum scientists
and engineers.</p>

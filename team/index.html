<p>For the last few years, our team has run educational events that have enabled thousands of attendees to experience the wonder of creating their own gadgets through science and engineering. Most of our work has been under the umbrella of <a href="https://swe.sites.yale.edu/gradswe-0">Yale’s Graduate Society of Women Engineers</a>, and in particular, their <a href="https://engineeringday.com">Engineering Day K-12 program</a>. We are proud to have channeled our passion for creating, teaching, and civil service to empower the next generation of makers. Through SpinWearables, we hope to reach even more students. All of the proceeds will go to funding the outreach events we run, providing free materials to students and teachers.</p>

Becky
</h1>
<h2>
Molecular Bioengineering
</h2>
<p><a href="/becky">Becky</a> decided to pursue biomedical engineering so she could use her skills in math and science to improve human health. As a graduate student at Yale, however, she has discovered a second passion: teaching engineering skills to the next generation of college students. Having come from a small high school with limited STEM offerings, she recognizes the value of early exposure to hands-on technical projects–not only for building skills but building confidence as well. She is excited to reach even more students through SpinWearables.</p>

Computational Microbiology
</h2>
<p>As a kid, <a href="/bridget">Bridget</a> was always asking “why?” Luckily, her parents put up with her incessant questioning and taught her to love the process of discovering new information. Bridget continues to pursue answers to her questions as a researcher at the University of Michigan, studying the microbes that survive in buildings. Outside of the lab, she shares her love of science and engineering by designing and leading activities that help participants, particularly girls, envision themselves as engineers. Through SpinWearables, she is excited to develop educational kits to inspire the next generation of engineers.</p>

<p>While a graduate student at Yale, <a href="/chris">Chris</a> was involved with many outreach activities in Yale’s Pathways to Science program, leading events for hundreds of students. Chris’s research at Yale focused on understanding the nature of the neutrino particle by searching for rare nuclear decays. After finishing his PhD, he now works as a Data Scientist for CarMax, but still remains active in STEM outreach. In his free time, Chris enjoys reading, hiking, and traveling around the world.</p>

<h2>
Experimental Cosmology
</h2>
<p><a href="/emily">Emily</a> is a PhD student in the Yale Physics Department. She spends most of her time building instruments for radio telescopes, and flying drones to measure these radio telescopes. This is all with the goal of understanding “Dark Energy”, which is this mysterious form of energy in the universe that is causing it to expand in an accelerating way. She also enjoys hiking, playing the flute, taking photos, SWE outreach, and hanging with her dog Cary.</p>

Nuclear Physics
</h2>
<p>Hannah is a PhD student in the Yale Physics Department. She works on the ALICE experiment which is a detector on the world’s largest machine; the Large Hadron Collider. There, she studies the results of the extremely hot and dense heavy-ion collisions which are designed to recreate the conditions of the early universe. Outside of physics, Hannah is a fan of almost anything outside. Whether it’s running, hiking, yoga, rock climbing, or skiing - she is always up for some time outside with friends!</p>

<h2>
Materials Engineering
</h2>
<p>Jack has always been passionate about both art and science. As a high schooler, he started an online business LiveWire ArtWorks to sell his jewelry and wire sculptures–much of which was inspired by nature. While at Brown, understanding the complexity and imaging the beauty of materials captivated his imagination and led him to major in materials engineering. Through TAing and tutoring for engineering courses, Jack discovered the joy of sharing science with others. Jack acts as an artistic consultant for the SpinWearables team.</p>
